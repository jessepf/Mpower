A disability may include an impairment, activity limitation, or participation restriction. It may be congenital; or occurring later due to sickness or accident; \u00a0or infirmities which come with ageing. \u00a0In essence, each of us is differently-abled\u2014 physically, or emotionally. Specific challenges may affect us or others: and each one is to be addressed individually:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Physical disabilities:<\/strong>\u00a0Disability that affects movement. This includes missing or reduced control of limbs, manual dexterity and disability in coordination with different organs of the body.<br \/>\nExample: Post-Polio Residual Palsy<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sensory impairment:<\/strong> Limited or complete absence of hearing and vision. This is caused through genetics, premature birth, infections or diseases. Example: Colour Blindness<\/p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual impairment:<\/strong> Originates before age 18. Characterized by significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour as expressed in conceptual, social and practical adaptive skills.<br \/>\nExample: Down syndrome<\/p>\n<p><strong>Developmental disabilities:<\/strong> Condition present at birth. This involves a life-long physical, cognitive or behavioural impairment.<br \/>\nExample: Cerebral Palsy, Autism Spectrum Disorder<\/p>\n<p><strong>Acquired impairments:<\/strong> Developed during the person\u2019s lifetime \u2013 that is, a disability that is the result of an accident or illness rather than a disability the person was born with.<br \/>\nExample: Spinal Cord Injury<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mental illness:<\/strong> Emotional and behavioural disorders causing lack of interpersonal skills and poor ability to function in life.<br \/>\nExample: Depression<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","image":14},{"id":18,"title":"The Hard Facts of Disability","excerpt":"<p>Facts and statistics about disability in India<\/p>\n","content":"<p>According to numbers of the Census 2011, India\u2019s population of people with disabilities increased by 22.4 % in 11 years.

This is due to poor implementation of \u201cThe Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 by the Department of Empowerment of Persons With Disabilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">The UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) has been ratified by India\u2014but is still pending in Parliament. If\u2014and when\u2014it is ratified, it would take the place of the 1995 Act with far-reaching benefits. Also, there is the national Trust Act which caters specifically for intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities; however, these schemes and benefits are implemented only in urban areas. Needs for people with disabilities in rural areas, still, remain unmet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Helvetica',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Consequently, it is imperative for NGO\u2019s, churches, and individuals to assist in advocacy, serving as a \u201cbridge\u201d to help them achieve basic rights and access various entitlements. Women, especially who are most often the caretakers, face significant social exclusion and discrimination on multiple levels. They need accurate information, empowering experiences and mutual encouragement of self-help groups, which enable them to become effective self-advocates.<\/span><\/p>\n","image":22}]
