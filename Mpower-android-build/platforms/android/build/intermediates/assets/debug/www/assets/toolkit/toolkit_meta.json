Over 750 million people worldwide are affected by disability; only 10% have access to the Gospel. The Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization have stated that people with a disability represent the <em>world\u2019s largest unreached people\u2019s group<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The lack of <em>active inclusion<\/em> in the Body of Christ is equivalent to <em>passive exclusion.<\/em> Jesus himself set the tone, reaching out to people with disabilities. When included, people with disabilities bless and grow the church; enabling the church to proclaim the Biblical message that ALL are created in the image of God. Inclusion illustrates that the church is indeed the Family of God, encouraging all people to become a part of the family. Receiving communion with the Body; providing music, dance or song; taking up collection; eating together\u2014and even participation in church governance; all are important facets of inclusion for a person with a disability.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEmotional inclusion\u201d becomes reality when the physical aspects of accessibility are addressed. The construction of a ramp allows entry, while removal of barriers enables the person to enter the church space. Liturgy should be made practical for those who are physically-disabled, hearing impaired, or emotionally challenged.\u00a0 Services should be designed to accommodate wheelchairs, or people with specific disabilities. And Sunday School can be a wonderful open door for those who are disabled, to enter the Kingdom of heaven!<\/p>\n","image":31},{"id":33,"title":"Etiquette in Responding to a Person with a Disability","excerpt":"<p>Watch your Language: Verbal and Body language belie your attitude toward people with disabilities<\/p>\n","content":"<p>Watch your Language: Verbal and Body language belie your attitude toward people with disabilities:<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Verbal<\/em><\/strong>: Instead of \u201clame\u201d, <em>physically challenged<\/em>; not \u201ccrippled\u201d, but <em>affected by disability<\/em>; not \u201cdumb\u201d, but <em>hearing impaired<\/em>; not \u201cblind\u201d, but <em>visually impaired<\/em>.
